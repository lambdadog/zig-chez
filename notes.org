* Loading our bootfiles
Set ~SCHEMEHEAPDIRS~ with ~putenv~ before running ~Sbuild_heap~
(~putenv~ is most cross platform, and we're already linking libC so we
probably don't need to worry about using it).

It's worth noting however, re: ~putenv~, Chez uses the underlying
Windows syscalls for their getenv reimplementation. Probably worth
figuring out why, as we'd ideally like to maintain maximum
compatibility with configurations chez is compatible with.
